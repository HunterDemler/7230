 <h3 style = "text-align:center;">CHILDREN LEARNING INDEPENDENTLY PROGRAM</h3>
 <p style = "margin: 0px 500px 0px 500px;"><strong>Due to the isolation of children and families during this pandemic, Kids Read has launched a new program to take the books directly to the children.  It is called CLIP.  We will  provide appropriate level workbooks to each child. These are the  currently and traditionally used education workbooks and learning supplies they are used to.  The Library Ambassador with the help of the Kids Read Tutors  will register and track the progress of children that live near the libraries.
 They will meet with their family at the library for instruction and guidance.</strong></p><br/>

						<p>The Hippo  Little Library was gifted to the children of Nsambya by Jeannine Marlowe and family. This is the 5th library Kids Read has dedicated.  More children turned out for this dedication than ever before!  We added
two  new features: the Sanitation Station where children were taught the importance of washing their hands  and a wonderful banner announcing our presence that day!  Great job by our Uganda Team ~
